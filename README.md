# Using-Djikstras-and-Floyd-Warshall-to-establish-a-connection-between-2-pair-of-nodes
The main aim of this project is to learn the concepts of virtual circuit switching and given a topology file and a connection request file, we try to establish a connection between the source and destination of the connection request keeping in mind the propagation between the nodes and the link capacity of the pair of nodes.
